This repository holds sample Android applications that show how tap&pay menu can be used by
NFC payment applications.

Source code
===========

The folder consists in 
- OffHostLib : code common to all applications
- cityziBank : sample payment application #1
- yellowBank : sample payment application #2
- greenBank : sample payment application #3

Each of the sample applications needs to be built against the OffHostLib. 
This should happen automatically thanks to the project.properties file in 
each application.


This sample code does not cover : 
- transaction management (capturing event transaction, this has long been documented now)
- UICC acccess : APDUs to acccess cardlet is not built into these samples

This code is meant to illustrate how to migrate payment applications from 
pre-KitKat version to Android 4.4 devices.
