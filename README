This repository holds sample Android applications that show how tap&pay menu can be used by
NFC payment applications.

The folder consists in 
- OffHostLib : code common to all applications
- cityziBank : sample payment application #1
- yellowBank : sample payment application #2
- greenBank : sample payment application #3

Each of the sample applications needs to be built against the OffHostLib. This sample code
does not include : 
- transaction management (capturing event transaction, this has long been documented now)
- UICC acccess : APDUs to acccess cardlet is not built into these samples

This code is meant to illustrate how to migrate payment applications from pre-KitKat version
to Android 4.4 devices.
